## PyMaze Escape README
A maze game from February 2019 in which you have to escape a tidal wave of lava

### Keys

ARROW KEYS = move up/down/left/right

r = restart game

p = pause game

SPACEBAR = resume/proceed (when prompted)

i = view 'HOW TO PLAY' in-game (on start screen)

ESC = emergency shutdown key (closes game)

### HOW TO PLAY:

Navigate the player (block) around the maze and try to aquire the amount of points needed to unlock the purple gate blocking the turquoise end point without getting hit by the wave of red lava coming from the left side of the screen.

There are many ways to obtain points. Yellow coins award 1 point, but be careful of the baby blue coins -- some will decrease your speed, while others will increase your speed! Look closely and you will be able to detect which ones are which. Don't forget about the red gate in the middle! Use the red-colored switch to deactivate it.
